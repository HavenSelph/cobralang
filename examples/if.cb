# Cobra has if statements as one would expect. They are very similar to Python's if statements, just add braces. The syntax is as follows:
"*
if (condition) {
    # do something
} elif (condition) {
    # do something else
} else {
    # do something else
}
*"

let x = 5
if (x == 5) {
    print("x is 5")
} elif (x == 6) {
    print("x is 6")
} else {
    print("x is not 5")
}

# Output: x is 5
